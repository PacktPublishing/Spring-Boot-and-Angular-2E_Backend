To migrate a Java application that uses a MongoDB connection string to Azure, you can follow these recommendations:\n\n * Use a managed **Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB**: Create a managed Cosmos DB for MongoDB database in Azure and choose the appropriate pricing tier based on your application's requirements for performance, storage, and availability.\n \n * **Connect to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB using Service Connector**: Create service connection using **Service Connector** to connect your application to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB. Service Connector provides a secure and easy way to connect your application to Azure services without having to manage secrets or credentials in your application code.\n\n * **Passwordless connections for Azure services**: Consider using passwordless connections for Azure services.
