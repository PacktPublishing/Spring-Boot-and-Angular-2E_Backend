**Bookstore Architecture - Diagram Documentation (Enhanced with Technical Context)**

---

### 1. Overview of Architecture

To build a modern, scalable, and cloud-native bookstore platform, this architecture introduces a modular design that segments the system into distinct layers for manageability, scalability, and security. Each layer plays a specific role in ensuring operational excellence, high availability, and developer productivity.

The solution is structured around microservices, integrating best-of-breed open-source tools and cloud-native principles. It adopts a frontend-backend separation using Angular and Spring Boot microservices, each secured and observable via industry-standard mechanisms.

> This section establishes the architecture's strategic purpose and modular layout to frame the technical exploration ahead.

### 2. Components Breakdown

In this section, we break down the architecture into core subsystems. Each component is analyzed in terms of technology, responsibilities, and its integration role in the overall system.

#### 2.1 Frontend Application

The Angular frontend is a responsive Single Page Application (SPA) that interacts with backend microservices via RESTful APIs. It incorporates Angular Signals for reactive state management and leverages Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for SEO optimization.

* **Technology**: Angular 20
* **Responsibilities**:

  * Handle UI rendering and state
  * Trigger secure API interactions
  * Provide responsiveness and SEO support

> The frontend is a dynamic client-side layer optimized for user engagement and API-driven modularity.

#### 2.2 API Gateway

This is the API entry point that abstracts microservice endpoints from the client. Spring Cloud Gateway handles routing, protocol transformation, and operational policies like rate limiting and circuit breaking.

* **Technology**: Spring Cloud Gateway
* **Responsibilities**:

  * Route API requests based on service registry
  * Intercept and validate JWT tokens
  * Enforce throttling and resiliency rules

> The API Gateway enhances system resiliency, scalability, and simplifies frontend-backend orchestration.

#### 2.3 Microservices Layer

Backend logic is encapsulated in independently deployable Spring Boot microservices. Each service is built using domain-driven design principles, clean architecture layers (controller, service, repository), and reactive integrations when needed.

* **Technology**: Java 21, Spring Boot 3.5
* **Inventory Service**:

  * CRUD operations on book data
  * Integration with PostgreSQL
* **User Management Service**:

  * User session, cart, and profile management
  * Uses MongoDB for flexible document storage

> These stateless services encapsulate business logic with decoupled, scalable runtime isolation.

#### 2.4 Datastore Layer

Each microservice owns its data source, following the database-per-service pattern. PostgreSQL is used for transactional consistency in inventory, while MongoDB supports document-oriented user data models.

* **PostgreSQL**:

  * Strong relational consistency
  * Ideal for structured catalog data
* **MongoDB**:

  * Schema-less design for flexibility
  * Efficient for nested or user-specific datasets

> This hybrid approach maximizes storage efficiency while meeting the specific needs of each domain model.

#### 2.5 Security

Security is enforced using industry-grade OAuth2 and OpenID Connect mechanisms. Identity is managed by Keycloak, and resource access is protected with Spring Security filters and JWT token validation.

* **Keycloak**:

  * Realm-based identity management
  * Token issuance and session control
* **Spring Security**:

  * Endpoint protection via filter chains
  * Supports method-level RBAC annotations

> Security is centralized, extensible, and seamlessly integrated with the applicationâ€™s runtime and identity layers.

#### 2.6 Observability

Service health and operational metrics are exposed via Spring Boot Actuator, scraped by Prometheus, and visualized in Grafana dashboards. Centralized logging using ELK/EFK stack ensures full traceability and fault diagnosis.

* **Prometheus**: Metric aggregation
* **Grafana**: Real-time dashboards
* **EFK/ELK Stack**: Centralized structured log analysis

> This observability stack enables proactive monitoring, diagnostics, and optimization insights.

### 3. Interaction Flow

A typical client request flows from the Angular frontend to the backend via API Gateway. Authenticated requests trigger specific microservice workflows. Each call is traceable, secure, and designed for failover.

1. Angular triggers user actions (e.g., view book list, checkout)
2. API Gateway validates JWT, applies rate limits
3. Inventory/User Service processes the request
4. Database operations are performed (SQL/NoSQL)
5. Responses are returned via gateway
6. Logs and metrics captured asynchronously

> This flow ensures request isolation, traceability, and integrity across distributed services.

### 4. Architectural Highlights

This final section distills the strengths of the architecture into key takeaways:

* **Secure-by-Design**: OAuth2/JWT, role-based access control
* **Cloud-Native**: Designed for Docker and Kubernetes
* **Microservice Modularity**: Bounded context and lifecycle per service
* **DevOps Friendly**: Ready for CI/CD, scalable deployment
* **Real-Time Observability**: Built-in metrics, logs, and health endpoints

> These strengths position the architecture to meet the demands of enterprise-grade digital commerce platforms.
